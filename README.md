# BrainBank

A living collection of technical notes, blog drafts, and real-world fixes from my journey as an IT consultant and homelabber.

This repo serves as my personal knowledge base and a way to document, share, and learn in public. I work across cloud infrastructure, automation, cybersecurity, and DevOps — and these notes reflect what I'm doing and learning in the field.
