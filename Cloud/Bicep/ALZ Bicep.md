We are very pleased to announce full Bicep automation in the Azure Landing Zones Accelerators. We now bootstrap CI / CD for you with a choice of GitHub or Azure DevOps. Head over to our docs to learn more: [https://lnkd.in/eKtCTzfX](https://lnkd.in/eKtCTzfX)

For both Bicep and Terraform, you can choose whether to use Microsoft or self-hosted runners / agents with private or public networking. We provision and configure everything you need to be up and running, there are no longer any manual steps required.

We've updated our blog post too: [https://lnkd.in/ebjAix_r](https://lnkd.in/ebjAix_r)

Go check it out and let us know what you think.

A huge thanks to Zach Trocinski and Jack Tracey for answering lots of daft questions and testing!
