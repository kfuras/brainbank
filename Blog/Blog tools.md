## GPTs List

Test

[Topical Authority Planner](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-aicbERBku-topical-authority-for-seo-gpt-generator)

is an absolute must for a new website or in case you pivot. Will also brainstorm new topics around subtopics with ease

[Whimsical Diagrams](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-vI2kaiM9N-whimsical-diagrams)

amazing mindmap tool that turns anything you generate inside ChatGPT into a mindmap. I generate a table, then add this custom GPT to the chat and generate (if you save it in the left panel, you can then type "@" in the chat field, and you can add any of your saved GPTs to the chat)

[Guest Post Pitch Creator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-NjexUknVn-seo-link-building-gpt-by-julian-goldie)

this tool will help you create three pitches you can customize and schedule in your outreach app.

[Internal Linking Tool](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Am73bZiQ9-free-ai-seo-internal-link-building-tool)

doesn't work perfect all the time, but def better than a free version of LinkWhisper, whose suggestions are mostly crap. This one might give you some ideas - just paste your sitemap, the text of your post and let it do its magic!

I'd love to share my own, too:

[Alt Text Assistant](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-SdtMr0hSN-alt-text-assistant-by-rushtechhub)

Throw in an image and a keyword, and it will try to create an SEO-optimized alt text using your keyword naturally

[Transcript to Blog](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-jCtiE7NSA-transcript-2-blog)

This one is quite controversial, but hey. Let's say you saw an amazing video, and you're inspired to write on the same topic. Copy the transcript (you can use [my tool)](https://rushtechhub.com/youtube-transcript/)

and this GPT will create an outline. Then, instruct it to go on, and it will write the whole piece of content heading by heading. You may say it's cheating. However, the output stinks like AI, so you will have to put a lot of work before you can post it😇

## Add shadow to Images in Kadence

You can add a simple bit of custom CSS in the customizer. Go to Appearance -> Customize and then choose "Additional CSS" at the bottom and add this code:

```CSS
/* Give all blog post images a box shadow to stand out */

.single-post .entry-content img {

box-shadow: 0 7px 20px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2);

}

/* Remove box-shadow on images with no-box-shadow class */

.single-post .entry-content .wp-block-image.no-box-shadow img, .single-post .entry-content .wp-block-kadence-image.no-box-shadow img {

box-shadow: none;

}
```

To explain the code a bit, the first section of code gives all images on your site (that are within a blog post) a box shadow.

The vast majority of the time, I want box shadows on the images in my blog post because it looks great, especially when creating tutorials.

However, there are some cases where you don't want a box shadow to show up for an image. For example, if you use one of my product boxes or have a simple logo of a company, many times it doesn't look good to have a box shadow on that image.

So, the second part of that code checks to see if there's a Gutenberg image (regular core image block) or Kadence Advanced Image and then if it has the additional CSS class of "no-box-shadow" which you can add in the "Advanced" section of a block, then it will remove the box shadow of that image.

Hope that helps!

## **Paragraph spacing in Kadence theme**

```CSS
:root {
--global-md-spacing: 1.2em;
}
```

## Install Wireframe in Kadence Blocks

The Design Library recently had a change, and the wireframes are no longer available by default. However, you can still use the Cloud Connect feature and gain access to the wireframes. Press the “+” button at the top of the Design library to access Cloud Connect, and add the connect URL of `https://wire.kadenceblocks.com/` with Key: `wire.`

## Install SB Blocks in Kadence Blocks

1. If you haven’t already, install the free [Kadence Blocks plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kadence-blocks/) and activate it on your site.
2. Open a post or page on your site and click the Kadence **Design Library** button on top of the page.
3. Click on the ‘**+**‘ icon, enter `https://cloud.startblogging101.com` for your **Connection URL** (no trailing slash), and the **License Key** `0000000` Then, click **Add Connection**.
